Kendra Initiative Overview:<P>

Kendra Initiative, an independent non-profit organisation, has been established to research and build an open architecture system that will provide the entertainment/content industry with a platform for content distribution and delivery over the Internet and facilitating revenue generation for content owners/aggregators and service providers.<P>

Broadband Internet access is increasing the appetite for high quality (high bandwidth) content. To alleviate net congestion Kendra Initiative is trialing a global content distribution system with ISPs and CDNs. By providing reliable, fast and easy to use systems Kendra Initiative aims to offer attractive alternatives for users currently copying/exchanging content.<P>

By bringing together content creators/owners and specialists from industry and academia Kendra Initiative is constructing a framework that will enable all organisations and individuals in the content distribution industry to exchange ideas and create this system, the Kendra system. Join us!<P>
